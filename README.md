This project contains programming logic problem solving.

## Getting Started

To check the execution and results, go to the directory for each problem:

```bash
cd <directory-name>
```

You will see two JavaScript files, one of which contains an initial resolution of the problem. The other, with the format `[reviewed].js` at the end of its name, is a second implementation, optimized in relation to the first. To run:

```bash
node <filename>
```
